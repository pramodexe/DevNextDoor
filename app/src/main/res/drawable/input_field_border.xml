    Input Field Border - Standard border for text input fields
    
    This drawable creates a border around text input fields like email,
    password, and message boxes. Think of it like a picture frame that
    goes around your text to make it look neat and organized.
    
    Used for:
    - Email input fields
    - Password text boxes
    - Message composition areas
    - Any text input that needs a border
    
    Visual properties:
    - Rounded rectangle with 8dp corner radius for modern appearance
    - Black stroke/border (#000000) with 2dp thickness for clear definition
    - No fill color (transparent inside) so text is clearly visible
    - Rounded corners prevent sharp edges that look dated
    - Border thickness provides good visibility without being overwhelming
