    Message Received Background - Background for incoming chat messages
    
    This drawable creates the background bubble for messages that you receive
    from other people in chat conversations. Think of it like a speech bubble
    in a comic book that shows what someone else is saying.
    
    Used for:
    - Incoming chat messages
    - Messages from other users
    - Received message bubbles in conversations
    - Any message that someone else sent to you
    
    Visual properties:
    - Rounded rectangle with 16dp corner radius for bubble-like appearance
    - Light gray background (#E5E5E5) to distinguish from sent messages
    - Smooth rounded corners create a friendly, modern chat bubble look
    - Light color indicates this is content from someone else, not you
    - Consistent with standard chat app design patterns
